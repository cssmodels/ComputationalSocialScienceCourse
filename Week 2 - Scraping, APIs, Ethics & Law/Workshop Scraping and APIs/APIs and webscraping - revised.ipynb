    "[Go to Solution](#miniproject2)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now go through a more complex exercise, for a small research paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have argued that the YouTube autoplay feature can lead to radicalization. The platform's recommendation system is designed to keep users engaged for as long as possible. The algorithm achieves this by suggesting content that it predicts the user will find interesting or compelling, based on their viewing history, search terms, and other interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, critics argue that this approach can create a \"filter bubble,\" where users are only exposed to content and perspectives similar to those they have already encountered, thereby reinforcing existing beliefs and opinions. There are concerns that this can lead to the incremental presentation of more extreme content, as users are gradually exposed to increasingly radical viewpoints in a bid to sustain engagement. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as \"algorithmic radicalization,\" has sparked debates about the ethical responsibilities of social media and content-sharing platforms and their role in the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and extremist ideologies. \n",
    "\n",
    "This would suggest that the comments on videos become more and more toxic as the algorithm proceeds!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we are going to explore this hypothesis by tracing the YouTube autoplay feature from a given starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the code we developed in our previous practical to fetch the comments on the video and evaluate their average toxicity. In case you did not complete that task, we will give you the solution here.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Youtube API gives access to some features, the \"next video\" feature is not accessible through the API. For this, we therefore need to scrape the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a video to start from. This might for instance be a political video, where you would expect a radicalization loop to take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write code to repeatedly go to the \"next upcoming video\" and store the number of steps taken, the video id and the title. (Remember to pause between each fetch, so the page has time to load.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Store at least 10 steps of \"next video\", so that a trend can be spotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use your code from the previous practical, where you collected comments on YouTube videos using the API, and calculated the toxicity of each comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For each video, calculate the average toxicity of the comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Plot the trend: are the comments becoming more toxic? Do your findings fit with the YouTube autoplay radicalization hypothesis?\n"
